# dockerfiles

This repo contains some of my useful Dockerfiles.
These don't all produce Docker images that I run directly, they serve more like building blocks for larger projects.

For example, I have Dockerfiles for Python libraries with non-trivial dependencies.
When I need one of those dependencies in a project, I'll copy the relevant parts from the Dockerfile in this repo, rather than re-deriving it from scratch.

This repo is more a collection of ideas than directly usable code -- grab stuff and do what you like with it.
